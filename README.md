## Usage

The application is launched from an Interactive Python environment (jp_crossword_puzzle.ipynb). Once launched, a new window will pop up and the user can start clicking the button Generate Puzzle. User will see a new random crossword puzzle generated and can start solving it by selecting the tile on the puzzle and click the correct japanese character for that tile. If it is incorrect, it will show as red. User can also display the answer if they are stuck. A new random puzzle is generated every time the Generate Puzzle button is clicked.
